# README

This is Martin's Nimble Test,
I had a week to do this but time really only a few days, however I'm quite
happy with the results i've been able to achieve from it.
Learnt a lot, since never used Nokogiri before, that was a challenge for me. 

* Ruby version 2.3.0
* Rails 5

* System dependencies
  Devise - got it working
  Doorkeeper - I installed it but wasn't too sure how to get the tokens to work, so it wasnt completed
  Nokogiri - Parsing the html of the keywords on google, that worked finally.
  Heroku - Tried doing this part but in the end it kept giving me an error, so couldnt get it to work.

For the csv file uploads I'll give an example of a csv file i've got!
